I scurried, more like scrambled, my way to the kitchen.
Tearing open a plastic wrapped loaf of bread, I stick a slice into the aluminum vertical convection oven.
"Why can't I ever make anything interesting for breakfast," I groveled.

There are times I wish I was back in Sela.
And there are times that I fall asleep.

Brushing my teeth, and then spitting into the sink, I look up to a figure of mangy mopped hair and sunken eyes.
I resembled a 70's hair band member that had been mummified and reanimated.
"Probably should do something about... that."

I pull my arms through a cream colored shirt, fasten the buttons, and wonder to myself when I ever decided to buy it. It did not suite me.
I was a serious person, but not fatalistically serious.

Checking my face one last time, I let out a sigh and push open the last set of doors.

My face hits the pungeant, sticky Dardinium air.

"Morning, Captain."

"Hello, Druv."

"Looks like you've been up early." Druv doesn't mask his amusement. He never has.
Despite being my subordinate, he treats me like an old rowdy cousin at a family reunion.

"Quite early." I said as I walk passed him, ignoring his smirk.
