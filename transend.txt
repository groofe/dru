I scurried. No, more like scrambled my way to the kitchen for some toast.
"Why can't I ever make anything interesting for breakfast," I groveled.
There are times I wish I was back in Sela.
Actually, those times are all the time.

Brushing my teeth, and then spitting into the sink, I look up to a figure of mangy mopped hair and sunken eyes.
I resembled a 70's hair band member that had been mummified and reanimated.
"Probably should do something about... that."

I pull my arms through a cream colored shirt. "Where did I even buy this awful thing."
And then pull on a clearly worn but clean gray pair trousers.

Checking my face one last time, I sigh and push open a set of doors.

My face hits the sticky, pungeant cloud of Dardinium air.
