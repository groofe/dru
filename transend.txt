I scurried, more like scrambled, my way to the kitchen.
Tearing open a plastic wrapped loaf of bread, I stick a slice into the aluminum vertical convection oven.
"Why can't I ever make anything interesting for breakfast," I groveled.

There are times I wish I was back in Sela.
And there are times that I fall asleep.

Brushing my teeth, and then spitting into the sink, I look up to a figure of mangy mopped hair and sunken eyes.
I resembled a 70's hair band member that had been mummified and reanimated.
"Probably should do something about... that."

I pull my arms through a cream colored shirt. Where did I even buy this awful thing, I whisper to myself while fastening buttons.

Checking my face one last time, I let out a sigh and push open the last set of doors.

My face hits the pungeant, sticky Dardinium air.
