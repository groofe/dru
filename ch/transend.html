I scurried, more like scrambled, my way to the kitchen. Tearing open a plastic wrapped loaf of bread, I stick a slice into the vertical convection oven. Another gourmet breakfast.

There are times I wish I was back in Sela. And there are times that I manage to fall asleep.

Brushing my teeth, and then spitting into the sink, I look up to a figure of mangy mopped hair and sunken eyes.
I resembled a 70's hair band member that had been mummified and reanimated.
"Probably should do something about that."

I pull my arms through a cream colored shirt, fasten the buttons, and wonder to myself when I ever decided to buy it. It did not suite me.
I was a serious person, but not fatalistically serious. Fatalistic people wear beige.

Checking my face one last time, I let out a sigh and push open the last set of doors.

My face hits the pungeant, sticky Dardinium air.

"Morning, Captain."

"Hello, Druver."

"Looks like you've been up early." Druver doesn't mask his amusement. He never has.
Despite being my subordinate, he treats me like an old rowdy cousin at a family reunion.

"Quite early." I said as I walk passed him, ignoring his crooked smile.

Taking a moment, I walk through my mental checklist.

"Centennial pods. Ah yes, there. Quadrophonic ambient pulsators, I think they would be... Here. As expected."

I rest my hand on my chin while I scan the factory floor.

"Sir, I need to bring some information to your attention." A slippery man says from behind. I've describe him as slippery in the past due to the way that he gels his hair back, and the fact that he seems to always be wet.

"Information? That's a strange way to put it Druver."

He looks at me with terror in his eyes. "Sorry sir, it's a tricky thing to start a conversation it is. You have to find the perfect opening statement that catches the attention and makes you want to listen to the rest. Perhaps I just found the wrong statement. Should I try again?"

I roll my eyes, and he stammers, "Sorry, I'll just get on with it then. We were informed that Bretu has struck an alliance with Hune and both have submitted orders for more subatomic particle diffusers."

"Alliance and yet ordering weapons?"

"Yes sir, it seems so."

It takes a minute for me to process the information before I understand. "They're planning to attack Dru."

"One can only hope that's not the case, sir."

He offers me a folder filled with papers, sealed with black tape and branded with the Druvian emblem.

I continue forward and push open the exit doors, turning a sharp left as I head out to sea.
