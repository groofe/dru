The cold chills to the bone. Every fiber of my being wants to run to someplace warm.

As I walk out the doorway, I nearly trip on a cooler resting in the snow.
Damn Brens gotta have their boogur juice wherever they go.

I was never a drinker. Didn't like it. It changed people.
In this bitter cold I'd love to be able to change my body temperature though. I check my pockets.

"Hm..." My hand touches metal. Pulling out the chromium circular egg-like device, I click in circular button on its face and stick it under my armpits.

"Ahhh. Best thing since gravitational space benders, I swear."

Feeling so warm my legs start to sweat, I put the device back in my pocket and wade my way through the snow toward an outpost located at the base of a vertical mountain face.
The ice building sits nestled underneath the mountain like an adopted infant mouse being caressed by its elephant mother.

There are many hardships for the mouse. But despite their differences (and occasional avalanches), they love each other.

I find it positively fascinating.

A burly fellow clothed in fur stacks ice in front of the outpost. He looks to be constructing something of a makeshift barricade.
"Captain Marvick, happy to see you again."

"Likewise, Brun. What have you been up?"

"Well actually, there is something." He motions me inside into a room that is dimly lit room. A single candle sits on a wooden table positioned in the center of the room, surrounded by a couple of wooden chairs. He beckons me into his study, another simple room of leather, wood, and paper.

"Look here." He points to an object resting in the middle of his desk atop hide, almost as if it would taint the stone underneath. At first glance, it looks to be a simple black stone. Jagged at the edges. Black as tar. Much like obsidian, only darker and more jagged edges that form to a point. But it fills the air around it with an ambient dark, heavy throb. Like a jagged slow beating heart with a sinister vibration. A raw ball of spikes that harken death.

"You found this?"

"Actually no. One of my men said they had found it stuck to one of their shoes on an expedition."

"Another omen from the Peaks of Dremla..."

"Yes. I'm not sure what this one means if I'm honest, Captain. Not that it's ever easy to decipher. But this one is most peculiar. Stuck to a shoe? A black rock?"

"I can bring this back yes?"

"Of course. We still have a deal."

"Farewell Brun." I say softly, as I reach for the door.

"There's a blizzard brewing out there. You should probably wait it out."

"I'll manage."

I shut the door behind me and pull my hood down, covering my mouth with the collar of my cloak.

It's cold.
