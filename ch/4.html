The cold chills to the bone. Every fiber of my being wants to run to someplace warm.

As I walk out the doorway, I nearly trip on a cooler resting in the snow.
Damn Bretons gotta have their boogur juice wherever they go.

I was never a drinker. Didn't like it. It changed people.
In this bitter cold I'd love to be able to change my body temperature though. I check my pockets.

"Hm..." My hand touches metal. Pulling out the chromium circular egg-like device, I click in circular button on its face and stick it under my armpits.

"Ahhh. Best thing since gravitional space benders, I swear."

Feeling so warm my legs start to sweat, I put the device back in my pocket and wade my way through the snow toward an outpost located at the base of a vertical mountain face.
The ice building sits nestled underneath the mountain like an adopted infant mouse being caressed by its elephant mother.

There are many hardships for the mouse. But despite their differences (and occassional avalanches), they love each other.

I find it positively fanscinating.
