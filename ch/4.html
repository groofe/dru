The cold chills to the bone.

Every fiber of my being wants to run to someplace warm.

I nearly trip on an object, which happens to be a cooler resting in the snow, as I walk through the doorway.
Damn Bretons gotta have their boogur juice wherever they go.

I was never a drinker. Didn't like how it changed people.
